# Texture Classification using Deep Learning
## Technique 1: 

1. Related research, papers:
	- [Model with SAE and using Texture Descriptors as vectorizers](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608017302320)
2. Issues:
	- Paper proposes 27 features based GLCM but can not find detailed documents
	- Can not implement sucessfully local spectral histogram extractor
3. to-do:
	- Solve the issues
	- Make comparision with technique 2

## Technique 2:

1. Related research, papers:
	- [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)
2. Issues:
	- Dataset with no test set. Hard to divide dataset to get a random testset.
3. to-do:
	- Solve the issues
	- Make comparision with technique 1
